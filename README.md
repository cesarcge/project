## Note

- **Input Format:** The input can be one or multiple lines at the same time.
- **Persistency**: There isn't a single kind of persistence for the actions if the program is closed. If that is needed, results can be saved to a JSON and loaded from there for each execution.
- **OOP**: All the main behavior is implemented within a class as requested by the task instructions, although it can also be accomplished using functional programming (FP).

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
- **Jest:** We use Jest for testing purposes.
